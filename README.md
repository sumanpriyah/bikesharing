The above graph give us the status of bikes and maintenance needed. The bikes used for more rides will get maintenance first. Per bike trips are calculated using 
bike id and total number of trips per bike. In this Bike id - 38124 got max trips 479.
on the left side where color range is dark and size of the block is bigger shows per Bike id count is higher and on right side with color is lighter and 
blocks getting small the number of trips per bikes are less. The bike with more trips will send for maintenance. From grapgh its easy to find which bikes need
maintenance by looking number of trips per bike id.
